title: "Q1 — Maximum Departure Delays by Airline"
---

# Question

**Find the maximal departure delay in minutes for each airline.\
Sort results from smallest to largest maximum delay. Output airline names and the delay values.**

## SQL Query

The SQL Query used to answer this question is provided below.

```sql
SELECT
    Reporting_Airline AS airline,
    MAX(DepDelay) AS max_delay
FROM al_perf
GROUP BY Reporting_Airline
ORDER BY max_delay ASC;
```

## Output 

The output of this SQL query is saved as `Question 1 output.csv`, and is provided below.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
q1 <- read_csv("data/Question 1 output.csv")
q1
```

## Visualization

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

q1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(airline, max_departure_delay),
             y = max_departure_delay)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#4C72B0") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Maximum Departure Delay by Airline",
    x = "Airline",
    y = "Maximum Delay (minutes)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

The visualization shows that maximum departure delays vary dramatically by airline, with some carriers experiencing extreme outlier delays exceeding 1,500 minutes. A small group of airlines—particularly AA, OO, and UA—record the highest maximum delays, indicating exposure to rare but severe operational disruptions. In contrast, several other airlines exhibit much lower worst-case delays, reflecting more stable performance or fewer extreme delay events.
